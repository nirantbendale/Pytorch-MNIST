# Chapter-wise Description of the Project

## Chapter 1: Introduction
The project begins with the import of essential libraries such as Torch, TorchVision, Matplotlib, and Torch's neural network modules. It defines a simple neural network architecture using PyTorch's `nn.Module` for classifying hand-written digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Chapter 2: Neural Network Architecture
This chapter introduces the defined neural network architecture named `Net`. It consists of two fully connected layers (`nn.Linear`) where the input image (28x28 pixels) is flattened and passed through a 500-unit hidden layer with a ReLU activation function. The output layer comprises 10 units representing digit classes, followed by a log-softmax activation function.

## Chapter 3: Model Initialization and Optimization
Here, the model is instantiated, and the loss function (Cross Entropy) and optimizer (Adam) are defined using the `nn.CrossEntropyLoss()` and `torch.optim.Adam()` functions, respectively. These components are essential for training the neural network.

## Chapter 4: Data Loading and Preprocessing
The MNIST dataset is loaded using TorchVision's `torchvision.datasets.MNIST`. This chapter covers how the dataset is downloaded, transformed using TorchVision's transforms (conversion to tensors and normalization), and loaded into train and test loaders using `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`.

## Chapter 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is conducted on the MNIST dataset. Sample images from the training data are displayed using Matplotlib's `plt.imshow()` function. Additionally, a bar plot showcases the frequency distribution of digits in the dataset, providing insights into the dataset's composition.

## Chapter 6: Model Training
The training process is detailed in this chapter. The model is trained over multiple epochs using a loop. Within each epoch, the training loader is iterated through batches, and the model parameters are optimized using backpropagation. Loss computation, backward propagation, and optimizer updates are performed to enhance the model's accuracy.

## Chapter 7: Model Evaluation
This section evaluates the trained model's performance on the test dataset. Test loader is utilized to iterate through test samples. Predictions are made using the trained model, and the accuracy of the model on the test set is calculated and displayed using the `torch.max()` function to obtain predicted classes.

## Chapter 8: Visualization of Test Results
The model's predictions on the test set are visualized in this chapter. The first 12 images from the test set are plotted along with their predicted and actual labels, aiding in visually assessing the model's performance.

## Chapter 9: Accuracy Calculation
The accuracy of the trained model on the test set is computed. The code snippet calculates the overall accuracy by comparing predicted labels with ground truth labels, providing a percentage value indicating the model's predictive performance.

Each chapter in this project serves a distinct purpose, collectively contributing to the understanding, implementation, training, evaluation, and visualization of a neural network for digit classification using the MNIST dataset.
